        <h2>Week 1 Day 1 - June 13, 2023</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Today, in the first week of my internship, I have the privilege of attending the Runestone Academy conference, where enthusiasts, authors, and people from different academic disciplines gathered to explore the world of open-source ebooks and PreTeXt. Throughout the first day of the conference, we engaged in discussions about consuming, collaborating, and co-creating ebooks, while also addressing the barriers and necessary scaffolding for each interaction category.</p>
        <br>
       
        <p>The conference began with introductions, fostering a sense of friendship among participants from diverse backgrounds with different experience levels with Pretext, ranging from novice to expert. We delved into the roles individuals play in the ebook ecosystem, including consumers (students), collaborators, and co-creators. From there, we explored the challenges faced by readers, such as accessibility, technical infrastructure, and user experience. Strategies to enhance accessibility, readability, and customization options were discussed to make ebooks more accessible and enjoyable for all.

        </p><br>

          <p>Collaboration, co-creation, and the idea of community were central themes at the conference. People seemed very friendly and everyone was very happy about helping each other with the things they struggled with. Authors and educators shared insights on fostering meaningful collaboration through interactive exercises, online communities, and peer-to-peer learning. The power of open-source platforms and the PreTeXt system was also celebrated, showcasing their potential in creating engaging, dynamic ebooks that invite readers to actively participate in the learning process.

          </p><br>

          <p>Attending the Runestone Academy conference is an enlightening experience that provided a comprehensive understanding of the roles, barriers, and scaffolding necessary for consuming, collaborating, and co-creating ebooks. It encourages participants to be inspired to shape the future of open-source ebooks and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of digital content.
