        <h2>Week 1 Day 3 - June 16, 2023</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This is the final blog post of the first week of my internship. Today was the last day of the Runestone conference which only lasted half a day as opposed to the other days where we were in the conference for a full day. During this 5 day period, I got to meet with a lot of new people, learn about the open source community as a whole, and experience the common practices in an open source environment. This is an opportunity I will always be greateful for.</p>
        <br>
       
        <p> In the afternoon, Dr. Pearce taught us many valuable pieces of information about the software development cycle. We learned about GIT version control system, GIT workflow, the etiquette of posting an issue and fixing an issue in a GitHub repository, etc. There was so much useful information that I will be using in my future career as a software developer. I came to the realization that it is a lot different to work as a solo software developer compared to working in a team. This is due to the fact that as a solo programmer, it is a lot easier to navigate through a project. On the other hand, as a group of software developers, we need to adopt an agile and scrum development methodology to effectively work and get through a project as a team.

        </p><br>

          <p> With the information we learned from Dr. Pearce, me and my teammates were able to post our first successful issue on GitHub and actually get to fix that issue. Learning this process by applying it on a real project brought me with experience that is invaluable as I believe that I will use this information very frequently in the future.
