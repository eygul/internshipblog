        <h2>Week 1 Day 2 - June 15, 2023</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Today is the second day of my blog post, however it is the fourth day of my internship and also the fourth day of the Runestone conference I am attending. So far, I am very much so impressed by the open source community. The conference was well-designed to achieve exactly what it wanted to achieve: to sustain the open source project. The activities we have been doing throughout the week aimed to develop Runestone project, and also to help people who are new with Runestone to  get started.</p>
        <br>
       
        <p> We got to be involved in different working groups, ranging from Getting Started with PreTeXt Authoring Tools to React JS working groups. They were all heavily beneficial for me to increase my understanding of the PreTeXt language, Runestone project, and also overall how the open source community works. We took notes during these working groups and these notes helped me create references for the technical topics I might struggle with in the future. 

        </p><br>

          <p> We also set up some software including Visual Studio Code, PreTeXt CLI, etc. I had some problems with my version of python so I spent a good amount of time trying to debug my problem. It was very exciting to take the first steps into being a part of the open source ecosystem, I know that I will learn so much from this experience, and I will also contribute as much as I can to this amazing community. Even though I am learning so many technical things, I am also learning about the open source community as a society, which encourages actions of friendship, helping each other, and honesty within itself.
